# HDF masterclass materials

These materials were used in masterclasses across Europe to introduce developers, data engineers, and data scientists to Apache Nifi. 

The labs contain a hands on tour of some of the key processors and patterns in Nifi, and can be run on a sandbox instance of Hortonworks Data Platform, with Nifi installed (https://github.com/abajwa-hw/ambari-nifi-service). The other side of the labs is intended to be on a small Nifi only instance. For this you might consider your own machine, or another simple sandbox VM.
