Instructor led demos
====================

This area is primarily for demos shown during the day by the instructor.

The main demo is based on a twitter collection pipeline and is intended to demonstrate:

1. back pressure
2. pressure release
3. lineage and provenance
4. resubmission

Note that when using the twitter demo you will need to specify valid twitter api credentials from https://apps.twitter.com/. The template will not save these by design thanks to NiFi's sensitive value handling.
